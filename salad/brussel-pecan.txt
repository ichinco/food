Roasted Brussels Sprouts Salad with Spiced Pecans 

The quantities are a bit approximate: aim for the sprouts/nuts/cheese
ratio that will make you happiest. Also, this dish would be great
served warm; just leave out the dressing.


ingredients


Salad:

2 pounds brussels sprouts
olive oil for drizzling
pinch salt
3 oz gruyère, diced
1 1/2 cups pecans
1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 tablespoons sugar
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon salt


Dressing:

1/4 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons red wine vinegar
pinch sugar


directions

Preheat oven to 450°F and position rack in upper third of oven. Trim
ends of brussel sprouts and cut in half. Toss with olive oil to coat,
sprinkle with a pinch of salt, then arrange on baking sheet with cut
sides down. Roast until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.

Lower heat to 325°F and line a baking sheet with foil. Toss pecans
with vegetable oil. In a small bowl, mix sugar, cayenne, and salt,
then add to pecan mixture and toss to coat. Scatter on baking sheet
and toast, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, 10-15
minutes. Let cool completely.

For dressing: mix oil and vinegar with sugar to taste. In a large
bowl, combine cooled sprouts, pecans, and gruyère. Add as much
dressing as you like; there’s already oil on the nuts and sprouts so
you may only need a little.
