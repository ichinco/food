Salt and pepper, to taste
2 cups vegetable broth
1 cup uncooked green lentils

Directions:

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Peel and chop sweet potatoes into a 1 inch dice. In a bowl mix with 1 tbsp oil and season with salt and pepper. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, stirring half way through.

2. Meanwhile, cook the lentils in a pot with 2 cups of broth over medium heat.
