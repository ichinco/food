White Bean and Kale Soup with Roasted Sausages and Tomatoes


ingredients

4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided
4 large cloves garlic, minced
1 yellow onion, diced
Fresh thyme (4-5 sprigs)
1/2 pound dry white beans, soaked overnight, rinsed and drained
4 cups chicken broth
1 pint grape tomatoes
Fresh oregano (1-2 sprigs)
1 bunch (about 1/2 pound) kale, thick stems removed
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in a large dutch oven
(or heavy bottomed soup kettle or pot).  Saute the garlic and onions
in the olive oil until translucent.  Add in a few sprigs of thyme
(stems and all).  Then, add the beans and chicken broth.  Bring to a
simmer, and cover.  Continue to simmer for about 1 1/2 hours.

Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375°F. Put the tomatoes in a large
baking dish.  Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
Chop the leaves from the remaining thyme and the oregano and sprinkle
over the tomatoes.  Season with salt and pepper.  Roast
for about 45 minutes until the tomatos are roasty.

Chop the kale and stir it into the soup.  Continue to simmer until the
kale has wilted down and is tender (about 5 – 10 minutes).  Stir in
the tomatoes.

Serve immediately topped with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
cheese.
