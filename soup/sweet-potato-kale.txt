Kale Sweet Potato Soup with Gruyere
makes 6 servings


ingredients

2 tablespoons olive oil
1½ cups finely chopped onion
2-3 garlic cloves, finely minced
8 cups chicken stock
4 cups diced sweet potatoes (about 1½ pounds)
pinch of salt
1 bay leaf
8 cups chopped fresh kale (about 1½ pound)
1 teaspoon dried basil
Gruyere cheese to shred/grate over top of soup


directions

Heat olive oil in large saucepan over medium heat. Cook onions until
tender, about 10 minutes. Add garlic, stock, sweet potatoes, salt, and
bay leaf. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, for
15 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are tender.

Stir in kale and basil. Cover and simmer for additional 10 minutes, or
until kale is tender.

Discard bay leaf.

Partially mash sweet potatoes in saucepan with a potato masher (they
should still be chunky). Ladle soup into bowls and serve topped with
shredded Gruyere cheese.
