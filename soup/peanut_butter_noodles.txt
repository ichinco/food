1-2tbsp green curry paste
1tsp agave nectar
1tsp seasame oil
.5tsp kosher salt
1tsp ground tumeric

1pkg extra firm tofu, cut into .25in cubes
1 15oz can full fat coconut milk

Wiz garlic, onion, ginger in blender. Heat oil over medium heat, cook mixture until soft and fragrant (3m). Add in the curry paste, agave, seasame oil, salt, tumeric, and soy sauce and cook for another 3 minutes, stirring everything together. Add in the tofu and gently toss the cubes to coat them with the flavered mixture. Next, pour in the coconut milk and broth. Bring the soup to a strong simmer, then turn the heat down to low and let it cook while you prepare the noodles and toppings.

Cook the noodles per the package directions (typically 6m in boiling water). Strain the noodles and toss them with the remaining tablespoon of canola oil.

Depending on your time, prepare the toppings by hand or use a food processor to shred the cabbage and finely chop the shallot, peanuts, and cilantro in quick batches. 

Before serving, finish the broth by whisking in the lime juice and peanut butter. Taste the broth and add more curry paste or soy sauce if need be. To serve, pile the noodles in the bottom of individual serving soup bowls, top with broth, and then pile on the toppings.
