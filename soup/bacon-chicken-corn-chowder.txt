6 strips bacon cut into small pieces
2 large chicken breasts cut into small bite-size pieces
1/2 medium onion chopped
2 sticks celery chopped
1/4 cup flour
2 cloves garlic minced
4 cups chicken broth or stock
2 cups frozen corn
1 cup heavy/whipping cream
3 large Russet potatoes diced
Dash Italian seasoning
Pinch cayenne pepper optional
Salt & pepper to taste
Scallions chopped, optional for serving

Prep your bacon (I find kitchen shears the easiest thing to cut it up with) and add it to a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook until crispy (about 10 minutes).

Meanwhile, prep your onion, celery, chicken and potatoes. 

Once the bacon is crispy, take it out of the pot and set it aside. Leave the grease in the pot (it adds a ton of flavor). 

Add the onion and celery to the pot and saut√© for 5 minutes.

Stir in the flour and cook for about a minute, stirring nearly constantly.

Add in the garlic, followed by the chicken broth. Give it a good stir to ensure the flour has dissolved and everything is scraped up from the bottom of the pot. 

Add in the chicken, corn, cream, potatoes, Italian seasoning, cayenne pepper, and 3/4 of the bacon (I save the rest for garnishing the bowls later on). Increase the heat to high and bring the soup to a boil. Once it's boiling, reduce the heat to a rapid simmer so it's gently boiling. 

Cook until the potatoes are done (about 15-20 minutes). Stir every so often. The soup will get thicker the longer you cook it.

Season the soup with salt & pepper as needed. Garnish with the rest of the bacon and chopped scallions if desired.
