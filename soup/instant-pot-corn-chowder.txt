INGREDIENTS:

4 slices bacon, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 onion, diced
4 red potatoes, chopped
1 (16-ounce) package frozen corn kernels
4 cups vegetable stock
1 teaspoon dried thyme
Pinch of cayenne pepper
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
3/4 cup heavy cream
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives
DIRECTIONS:

Set 6-qt Instant Pot® to the high saute setting. Add bacon and cook until brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes. 
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.

Add garlic and onion. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions have become translucent, about 2-3 minutes.

Stir in bacon, potatoes, corn, vegetable stock, thyme and cayenne pepper; season with salt and pepper, to taste. 
Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for 10 minutes. When finished cooking, 
quick-release pressure according to manufacturer’s directions.

In a small bowl, whisk together heavy cream and flour; set aside.

Select high sauté setting. Bring to a boil; stir in heavy cream mixture and cook, stirring frequently, 
until slightly thickened, about 4-5 minutes. If the mixture is too thick, add more vegetable 
stock as needed until desired consistency is reached.

Serve immediately, garnished with chives, if desired.
