Tomato Soup

Ingredients
1 tablespoon olive oil or butter
1 large onion, diced (about 2 cups)
3 medium carrots, thinly sliced (about 1 heaping cup)
2 28-oz cans whole or diced tomatoes (San Marzano if you have them)
2 14-oz cans chicken broth (or vegetable or even beef)
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
heaping 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves
1/2 cup cream (more if desired)

Turn pressure cooker to saute.  Add butter or olive oil, onion, and carrot and saute, 
until starting to soften, 3-4 minutes.  Add in tomatoes (juices and all), broth, salt and pepper.  

Secure lid on pressure cooker and set to high pressure for 10 minutes.  
You can immediately release pressure when done, or let it come down naturally if you have time.  
Use an immersion blender or an actual blender to puree. 

Add fresh basil and pulse again to blend.  Finally add cream and blend together.
