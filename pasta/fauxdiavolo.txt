This can't possibly feed more than 2 people for lunch. You probably
want to throw in 4ish shrimps and some more sauce if you're making
dinner. If you want to feed even more people, then make it again in
a separate batch. 

We can't possibly guarantee that the usual doubling strategy is going 
to be any good.

OIL MIXTURE
===========

Add the following into a small bowl:

1   oz of olive oil
2   tsp of Italian spice mix
1/2 tsp of cayenne

dash of dried garlic powder
dash of parsley flake
dash of dried basil leaves

Mix and let everything soak for a little bit (5min). Then pour this 
into the pan.

On LOW heat, cook for at least 2min. And then you can leave that for as 
long as you want. It really doesn't matter.

SHRIMP
======

Put 22ish raw shrimp into a bowl, dried as much as possible. 

If you are thawing frozen shrimp, leave the shrimp a little frozen
internally, but make sure the shrimp are all separated from each
other and the outside is all thawed.

Mix the 22ish shrimp already in the bowl with:

1   tbsp of olive oil
1/2 tsp of cayenne
1/2 tsp of Italian spice mix
1/2 tsp of minced garlic
1   tbsp of sherry or rice wine

Let it sit for 15 - 20ish minutes. Mix the bunch every now
and then. It helps with circulating the flavor.

PARSLEY
=======

Fresh. Wash and very finely cut up about 5 - 7 sprigs. 
Should be enough. This will be the garnish for the end.

COOKING
=======

You should have the following things handy, if possible. Otherwise, don't
sweat it, just ask someone for them -- shout a bit is fine -- especially
if there's some person who knows where things are

- Shrimp
- Pasta sauce
- Lemon and zester
- Cayenne + teaspoon
- Butter + a knife
- Pepper flakes
- Chopped parsley

1. Heat up the oil mixture on high for a few seconds (20s -- something
   like that). Spread the oil around. Add the shrimps, and spread them out.

2. They will stop being translucent in about 10s, and so count to 10 and start
   flipping them around immediately. Take some time to take in the smell. It's
   going to excite you.

   Once both sides of the shrimp stop being translucent -- even if the shrimp
   is not completely cooked, that's ok. Turn the heat down to MEDIUM - LOW
   (probably 2 notches past medium).

3. Add enough pasta sauce to cover the tops of the shrimp. I'm not sure how
   much sauce that is. Probably useless to measure it out anyway.

3. Zest 1/4 of a lemon by surface area directly into the pot. Stir it around
   and see if you can smell the lemon. If not, zest a bit more.
   
4. If you want this to be more spicy, add in another 1/8 tsp of cayenne.

5. Cook for 3 - 4min on Add 3/8" - 1/2" of butter stick. Just eyeball it. If
   measure it, it's going to waste too much time.
   
6. Throw in a dash of pepper flakes.   
   
7. Cook for another 2 - 3min and it should be good to serve. To keep the 
   shrimp from overcooking, you might want to just remove the pan from any
   heat source. The shrimp and sauce will carry on cooking, but it's going
   to be slower.
   
8. Dish out into a bed of pasta -- any kind. Works great with linguine,
   fettuccine and spaghetti. Throw some parsley on top.
