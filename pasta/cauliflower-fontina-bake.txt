serves 6-8

ingredients
1 large head cauliflower
1lb campanelle (or casarecce) pasta
1tbsp olive oil
2tbsp unsalted butter 
1 large onion
1 bunch spinach (12oz-1lb)
.5c white wine
1.25c whole milk
.5c heavy cream
1c parmesan cheese
1.25c (6oz) fontina cheese
1tsp chopped fresh rosemary leaves
1.5tsp choped fresh thyme leaves

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the cauliflower florets, return to a boil, and cook until they are just tender, 4-5m. Using a spider, transfer the cauliflower to a colander and drain.

Return the water to a boil, add the pasta, and cook according to package directions until al dente, about 9m. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot.

Preheat the oven to 450F.

Heat the olive oil and butter in a large, deep saute pan or Duch oven over medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onion and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until they have softened and the garlic is fragrant, about 3m. Add the cauliflower and cook, stirring occasionally, over medium high heat until the cauliflower browns slightly, 6-8m.

Add the spinach and cook until it begins to wilt. Season with .5tsp of salt and .25tsp of pepper. Add the wine and simmer, stirring occassionally, until it mostly evaporates, about 2m. Turn off the heat. Stir in the milk, cream, .75c of the parmesan, the fontina, rosemary, and thyme.

Add the pasta to the cauliflower mixture and stir to combine. 

Lightly grease a 3qt baking dish with butter and transfer the pasta mixture. Make sure to scrape out all the sauce. (Can be left in fridge for 1 day at this point).

Cover the top of the pasta evenly with breadcrumbs and the remaining parmesan . Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Bake until the sauce is bubbling up along the sides of the pan, 18-20m. Let the pasta stand briefly before serving.
