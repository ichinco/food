Rinse the dal and put it in the instant pot. Add bay leaves, garlic, ginger, and water. Cook 
on high pressure for 30 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally.

In a small bowl, mix yogurt, half-and-half, salt, tumeric, cayenne, cumin, coriander, and
garam masala. Mix thoroughly.

When the dal is ready, gently mash using the back of a spoon to make it thicker.

In a small saucepan, heat the ghee over medium heat until it simmers. Add the cumin seeds until they
sputter. Add the tomato paste and cook until it absorbs all the ghee. (2m)

Pour paste and yogurt into dal and mix well.
