1 loaf French Brioche Bread, sliced
16 oz light ricotta cheese
1 lemon, zested
1/4 cup powdered sugar, plus some to dust
1 cup chopped strawberries, plus some to garnish
6 eggs
1/2 cup almond milk
2 tsp vanilla, divided
Pinch of salt
Coconut sugar to dust

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease an 8X8 pan and set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl, combine ricotta, powdered sugar, lemon zest, vanilla, salt, and strawberries. 
Refrigerate until ready to use.

Whisk together eggs, milk, remaining vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Pout into a wide bowl.

Cut each piece of bread diagonally and dip each side into the egg mixture—make sure both sides are fully coated. 

Next, place 1/4 cup of ricotta in between the bread and lightly sandwich together. 

Place in pan so that the pointed corner is facing up. Repeat until pan is full—you may have a piece or two of bread left over.

Pour remaining egg mixture over the French toast. Sprinkle with a dusting of coconut or cane sugar, 
cover with foil, and place in oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove foil and bake for another 
10-15 minutes; make sure the egg in the center is fully cooked through.

Serve hot with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries!
