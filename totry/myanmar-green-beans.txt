Myanmar Style Long Bean Salad

1/2 lb. long beans cut thinly lengthwise on the bias into 2" pieces
1 1/2 cups peanut oil
2 shallots, very thinly sliced
2 tbsp. finely chopped roasted peanuts
4 1/2 tsp. fish sauce
1 tbsp. fresh lime juice
2 tsp. sugar
Salt

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add long beans, cook until crisp-tender, about 1 minute. 
Drain long beans; rinse under cold running water; set aside. Heat oil in a small pot over 
medium heat until temperature reaches 325° on a deep-fry thermometer. Add shallots and 
fry, stirring, until golden, 3-4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a paper 
towel-lined plate. Reserve the frying oil. In a medium bowl, toss together the long beans, 
peanuts, fish sauce, lime juice, sugar, and 1 tbsp. of the frying oil (reserve remaining oil for 
another use). Season the salad with salt to taste. Sprinkle shallots on top of the salad just 
before serving.
