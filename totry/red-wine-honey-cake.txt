3 grams baking soda (1/2 teaspoon)
3 grams salt (1/2 teaspoon)
2 grams cinnamon (1 1/2 teaspoons)
2 grams cardamom (1 teaspoon)
2 grams ground ginger (1 teaspoon)

PREPARATION

1.
Place a rack in the middle of the oven; heat to 350 degrees. Generously grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt pan, including center tube.
2.
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices.
3.
In another large bowl, whisk eggs well. Whisk in sugar, oil, 1 cup honey, the wine and the fresh ginger until well combined. Whisk in dry ingredients until smooth.
4.
Pour batter into pan and bake until springy to the touch and a cake tester comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool for about 20 minutes, then unmold the cake and let cool completely.
5.
Meanwhile, pit and quarter plums. In a medium bowl, toss plums with remaining 2 tablespoons honey and the thyme. Add more honey to taste and let macerate for at least 30 minutes. Serve cake sliced and garnished with plums and thyme branches.
