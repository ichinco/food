Basic Vinaigrette

You have to decide whether you like 50 percent vinegar, 30 percent or more like 25 percent. Experiment. But start with 1/2 cup good olive oil, 1/4 cup lemon juice or sherry (or other) vinegar, a minced shallot and some salt and pepper. If you use a blender, the emulsion will hold for days.

Sesame Dipping Sauce

Whisk together two tablespoons dark sesame oil, two tablespoons peanut oil, one tablespoon minced onion or shallot or a little garlic, two tablespoons soy sauce and, if you like, one tablespoon sesame seeds or finely chopped peanuts. Cilantro is a good garnish.

Tahini Sauce

Combine 1/2 cup tahini with some of its oil, 1/2 cup water, the juice of one lemon, one peeled garlic clove, salt, pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin in a food processor; process until smooth. Or whisk the ingredients in a bowl (mince the garlic first). Taste and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon juice, oil, water or garlic as needed.

Pico de Gallo

Combine 1 1/2 cup chopped fresh tomatoes, 1/2 large chopped white onion or three or four scallions, one teaspoon minced garlic, minced fresh chile (jalapeño, Thai or habanero) to taste, 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley leaves and two tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice or one tablespoon red wine vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste and let sit to allow the flavors to develop.

Raw Onion Chutney

Finely chop two small to medium or one large white onion and combine with one teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon coarsely cracked black peppercorns, 1/4 cup red wine (or distilled white) vinegar and one teaspoon paprika. Let sit for an hour. Stir in cayenne to taste, then taste and adjust seasoning.
