4 (6- to 8-ounce) skin-on salmon fillets
 Cut vegetables, fresh herbs and/or slices of lemon, lime or orange
 Salt and pepper
 

Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Cut 4 large heart-shaped pieces of parchment paper or foil, 
and place them on a sheet pan. Fold the parchment or foil in half down the middle, place 
a fillet with its garnishes and seasonings on one side of each, fold the other side over 
and crimp the rounded edge tightly closed.

Place in oven for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on how done youâ€™d like to serve the salmon. 
The packages should puff up and make for dramatic serving.
