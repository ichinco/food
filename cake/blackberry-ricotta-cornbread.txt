Blackberry Ricotta Cornbread adapted from eatmakeread
Makes 8 slices


Ingredients

1 cup all-purpose flour plus 1 tbsp flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal
1 tbsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
1 cup whole milk
¼ cup vegetable oil
1 egg
4 tbsp sugar (more if you want the sweeter version)
1 to 2 tbsp honey or agave nectar-optional (I added this)
¼ tsp baking soda
¾ cup cooked corn (I left this out)
½ cup ricotta
1 1/4 cups fresh blackberries
3 tbsp butter
whipped cream, butter, honey- garnish (add honey, for a change, in
place of sugar if you make it yourself)


Directions

Preheat the oven to 375. In a large bowl, sift the 1 cup of flour,
cornmeal, baking powder and salt together. In another bowl, whisk the
milk, oil, egg, sugar, optional honey and baking soda. Fold the wet
ingredients into the dry.

In another bowl, coat the berries with the remaining 1 tbsp of flour
and fold into the batter with the corn and ricotta. Don’t stir too
much, just until incorporated.

Over low/medium heat, in a cast iron skillet, melt the butter. Be sure
to coat the bottom and sides of the skillet. Cook for just a few
minutes, until it smells nutty. Pour the batter into the skillet and
bake until golden, 30 to 40 minutes. I had to cover it with foil
half-way through so be mindful of burning. Cool for 5 minutes, cut and
serve. Garnish with butter, honey, or whipped cream.
