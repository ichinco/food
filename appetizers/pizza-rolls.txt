Stuffed Pizza Rolls
by OurBestBites

Ingredients

1 roll refrigerated pizza dough
marinara/pizza sauce
2 Tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 Tablespoon melted butter
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
mozzerella cheese, diced or grated (diced is the least messy to use when stuffing the rolls)


Directions

Pizza toppings of your choice: ie, ham and pineapple, pepperoni
slices, sausage, etc.

Preheat oven to heat specified on pizza dough package. Usually it's
400 degrees. If you make your own dough, 400 is usually a good heat as
well.

Unroll your pizza dough onto a lightly floured surface. Pat or roll
the dough so it's about 12" by 8". You're going to want to cut it into
24 squares, so just eyeball it if you need to. Use a pizza cutter to
slice the dough into 24 squares.

Place cheese and desired toppings on each square. Just eyeball how
much. You just need to be able to enclose the toppings in the dough so
keep that in mind. *Don't put marinara in the rolls. Save it for
dipping.

When all of your dough squares have cheese and toppings on them,
carefully lift up each square and wrap the dough around the
toppings. Pinch to make sure each ball is sealed shut and then place
them seam side down in a lightly sprayed pie pan (or similar sized
dish).

Brush the tops of the dough balls with olive oil or melted butter and
then sprinkle with the garlic and Italian seasoning and top with
Parmesan cheese.  Cook them in the oven for about 15-20 minutes or
until golden brown on top. Keep an eye on them! Doughs vary, so I'd
check them after even 10 minutes.

Serve warm with warmed marinara sauce on the side for dipping.
