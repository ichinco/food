Stuffed Tomato With Israeli Couscous & Spinach

ingredients

4 beefsteak tomatoes (cored and placed in boiling water for 5 minutes, then pat dry and put aside) 
1 c. Israeli couscous (cooked according to instructions.  I usually put 1 tsp. of consomme in the water so a little extra flavor gets all in the grain)
4 T. olive oil
2 c. packed spinach leaves
2 cloves of garlic (peeled and thinly sliced)
1 tsp. nutmeg
1 T. dill
1 T. grated lemon zest 
4 oz. crumbled feta
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper taste


directions

Preheat oven to 375 degrees

Once tomatoes have been removed from the boiling water (they should be tender, but not soft as they will have to hold up whence theyÎéÎ÷re stuffed and put in the oven to continue cooking) lube up each tomato with a teaspoon of olive oil and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper then transfer to a baking sheet and put aside

Heat 2 T. of olive oil in a large skillet, add garlic and saute until browned - about 3 to 4 minutes - but being careful so as not to burn

Add spinach and saute for 5 minutes, then add nutmeg, dill,  lemon zest and continue to cook until spinach is completely broken down

Transfer cooked couscous to the pan with the spinach and mix well, then add crumbled feta and salt and pepper to taste

Stuff each tomato with the spinach and couscous mixture

Topping each tomato with a slice of lemon and drizzling with remaining olive oil

Cook in the oven for 35-40 minutes and serve
