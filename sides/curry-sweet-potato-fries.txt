1 cup curry-ginger oil
1 bunch of scallions
kosher salt and black pepper

make rectangles. cut lengthwise into .5-in-wide slices. stack and cut
in to .5-in-wide fries. dry potoatos well.

2. in a bowl, combine curry-ginger oil and all but 2 tbsp of the
scallions. Add the potatoes, season, and toss.

3. Heat oven to 400F and place heavy sheet pan or heavy skillet in
it. When hot, put the potatos on (they should sizzle-- otherwise, heat
more).

4. Bake until golden brown (10-15 mins)

5. Turn potatoes and cook until uncolored side is golden. If bottoms
brown too rapidly, turn and lower heat to 350F. Toothpick should
penetrate potatoes easily when done.

for the crispest fries, rinse the cut potatoes in hot water 3 times,
drain, and soak in a bowl of hot water for .5 hr, then drain and dry
well. (removes excess starch to help ensure crisping)
